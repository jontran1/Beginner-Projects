Deal seven cards to each player, one at a time and face-down. The rest of the deck is not needed.  The aim of the game is to try and collect seven cards from the same suit (eg seven spades). Keeping the cards hidden, the players sort their cards by suits and decide which suit to collect (although they may change their mind as play progresses).  Then, each player puts an unwanted card face down on the table and slides it to the player on the right, who takes it up. Try to do this in a rhythm so that all players are passing and picking up at the same time. Continue until one player's hand is all one suit. He shouts "My Ship Sails!" and wins the game.
